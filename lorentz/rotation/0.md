# Rotations 0

We start by reviewing the three-dimensional rotation group, where the metric is simple:

$$\eta_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$$

Distances from the origin are measured using the Pythagoras theorem:

$$r^2=x^i x^j\eta_{ij}=x^1x^1+x^2x^2+x^3x^3=x^2+y^2+z^2 \tag{1}$$

The above formula sequence involves illegal overloading of the $x$-variable, and further confusion between a component label and squaring. I present it to show the connection of labeled variables and the usual $x,y,z$ co-ordinates relative to orthogonal axes, and I hope there is no confusion due to ambiguities.

We can look at vectors $\mathbf{r}=x^i\mathbf{e}_i$ as co-ordinate independent objects with the co-ordinates arising when cast onto an orthogonal frame of unit vectors $\{\mathbf{e}_i\}$.

Orthogonality is defined in terms of the scalar product $\mathbf{e}_i\cdot \mathbf{e}_j=\eta_{ij}$, which gives, using the usual bilinear properties, $r^2=\mathbf{r}\cdot \mathbf{r}=x^i x^j\eta_{ij}$, as expected. Taking the scalar product with the axes vectors, $\mathbf{r}\cdot \mathbf{e}_i=x^j\eta_{ij}$, or $x^i=\eta^{ij}\mathbf{r}\cdot \mathbf{e}_j$, where we define $\eta^{ij}$ as the inverse of $\eta_{ij}$, i.e. $\eta^{ik}\eta_{kj}=\delta^i_j.$

Anyway, a rotation of the axes leads to a new rendering of the co-ordinates (passive view of rotations): $x'^i=R^i_jx^j.$ We want the distance from the origin to be unchanged: $$r^2=x'^ix'^j\eta_{ij}=x^ix^j\eta_{ij}.$$

Rotations also conserve angles, meaning the scalar product of two general vectors should also be invariant: $$\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{s}=x'^iy'^j\eta_{ij}=x^iy^j\eta_{ij}.$$

This allows us to disentangle the defining characteristics of rotation matrices: $$x^iR_i^ky^jR_j^l\eta_{kl}=x^iy^j\eta_{ij} \implies R_i^kR_j^l\eta_{kl}=\eta_{ij}$$

We want to explore the region of rotations around the identity, so we express $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{I}+\Omega$ or, in components, $R^i_j=\delta^i_j+\omega^i_j.$ Plugging this into the defining characteristic for the rotations: $$R_i^kR_j^l\eta_{kl}=(\delta^k_i+\omega^k_i)(\delta^l_j+\omega^l_j)\eta_{kl}=\eta_{ij}+(\omega^k_i\eta_{kj}+\omega^l_j\eta_{il})+\omega^k_i\omega^l_j\eta_{kl}$$

If we assume $\omega^i_j$ is “small”, we need concern ourselves only with the bracketed term, which tends to zero if the above expression is to equal $\eta_{ij}$ and the last term is ignored: $$\omega^k_i\eta_{kj}+\omega^l_j\eta_{il}=0$$

We can clarify, perhaps, what is going on by lowering the indices,
$\omega_{ij}=\omega^k_i\eta_{kj}$, to give $\omega_{ij}+\omega_{ji}=0.$ The $\omega$ with lowered inidices is anti-symmetric in them.

Another thing to notice is that:
$$\eta^{ij}[\omega^k_i\eta_{kj}+\omega^l_j\eta_{il}]=2\mathrm{Tr}[\Omega]=0$$

The consequence of this is that the deterimant of $\mathrm R$ is unchanged relative to $\mathrm{det}[\mathrm I]=1.$ To justifiy these statements requires differential calculus on matrices/linear operators, which I won’t get into here.

There are pseudo-rotations that include reflections, which also conserve scalar products, but have determinant of $-1$. These cannot be reached smoothly from the identity.

Apart from the second formula above $\ref{1}$, we have not really used the three-dimensional nature we are aiming at (for now), so much of the above can be implemented in a space of arbitrary dimension. Further the use of $\eta$ rather than going straight to $\delta$ allows a fairly direct transfer of knowledge to pseudo-metrics like that needed for Lorentz transformations.
