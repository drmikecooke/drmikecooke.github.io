<h2 id="talkin-bout-my-generation">Talkin’ ’bout my generation</h2>
<p>We have loosely considered “infinitesimal” rotations generated on the definitional n-dimensional space by <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. These small rotations can be compounded to give finite ones in the limit, much as one can view exponentials as a product of increasingly small linear displacements: <span class="math display">\[\exp(x)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(1+\frac x n\right)^n\]</span></p>
<p>To do this it is useful to separate off the parameterization of the rotation group from those arising from the base space in which the rotations are envisaged as acting. There are a number of reasons for this as will become apparent as we proceed.</p>
<p>As our finite-izable parameters we will use the antisymmetric set <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ab}\)</span>. That they are group parameters, we indicate with subscripts in the early part of the alphabet. For the action on (Euclidean) space, we have a set of generators, <span class="math inline">\((\mathrm J^{ab})^i_j\)</span>, with the super-/sub-scripts near to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> indicating their reference to space (or later representation) co-ordinates.</p>
<p>The finite group action is given by <span class="math display">\[\exp\left(\frac 1 2\omega_{ab}\mathrm J^{ab}\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\mathrm I+\frac {\omega_{ab}\mathrm J^{ab}} {2n}\right)^n.\]</span> The factor of <span class="math inline">\(\frac 1 2\)</span> accounts for the double counting arising from the antisymmetry of the parameters. Since <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> projects out the antisymmetric part of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm J\)</span>, only <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm J^{ab}=-\mathrm J^{ba}\)</span> is meaningful for the group, and hence the double counting.</p>
<p>The product is taken in the sense of matrix multiplication with <span class="math inline">\((\mathrm I)^i_j = \delta^i_j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\mathrm J^{ab})^i_j\)</span>. Initially we will do this in the base space. Occasionally we may slip and write <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm I\)</span>. I hope you will be able to correct in your head for these and other such, errors.</p>
<p>We now want to work out what the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm J^{ab}\)</span> generators actually are. We start from <span class="math inline">\(\frac 1 2\omega_{ab}(\mathrm J^{ab})^i_j=\omega^i_j.\)</span> We also need from the previous page, expressed with <span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> subscripts: <span class="math display">\[\omega_{ab}=\omega^k_a\eta_{kb}\implies \omega^i_j=\omega_{ab}\eta^{bi}\delta^a_j.\]</span></p>
<p>Taking our equation we get: <span class="math display">\[\frac 1 2\omega_{ab}(\mathrm J^{ab})^i_j=\omega_{ab}\eta^{bi}\delta^a_j=\frac 1 2\omega_{ab}(\eta^{bi}\delta^a_j-\eta^{ai}\delta^b_j)\]</span></p>
<p>This gives us: <span class="math display">\[(\mathrm J^{ab})^i_j=\eta^{bi}\delta^a_j-\eta^{ai}\delta^b_j.\]</span></p>
<p>The Lie algebra is found by making commutators, <span class="math inline">\([\mathrm J^{ab},\mathrm J^{cd}]=\mathrm J^{ab}\mathrm J^{cd}-\mathrm J^{cd}\mathrm J^{ab}.\)</span> An example term of the product <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm J^{ab}\mathrm J^{cd}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\eta^{bi}\delta^a_k\eta^{dk}\delta^c_j=\eta^{da}\eta^{bi}\delta^c_j.\)</span> One finds after brute-force calculation or using antisymmetry arguments (I did a combination): <span class="math display">\[[\mathrm J^{ab},\mathrm J^{cd}]=\eta^{bd}\mathrm J^{ac}-\eta^{ad}\mathrm J^{bc}-\eta^{bc}\mathrm J^{ad}+\eta^{ac}\mathrm J^{bd}.\]</span> We note that the result is a linear combination of generators, as expected for a Lie group. We could even create an expression for the structure constants, but I’m not sure that would be useful at this stage.</p>
