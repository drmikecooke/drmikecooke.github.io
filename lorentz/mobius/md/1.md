# M&ouml;bius transformations

## Polynomials

My understand on this is a work in progress. The literature seems very confusing, except for experts. It is also somewhat sparse. I am working from a book, _Theory of Spinors_, Carmeli and Malin, which confuses me.

Let&rsquo;s start from the simplest &ldquo;polynomial&rdquo;, $a+bz$, where $z$ is an element of $\mathbb{CP}^1$, which in homogeneous form is $[z:1]$.

If we act on this polynomial with a M&ouml;bius transformation, the result is _not_ a polynomial in $z$. What if (and Carmeli/Malin _don&rsquo;t_ do this), we look at the homogeneous form $az_2+bz_1$, where we have expressed the original polynomial for a homogeneous pair,  $[z_1:z_2]$. I think I am treading on the ground of algebraic geometry (_not_ the same as geometric algebra), which I also find confusing.
