<p>We have seen that there is a close connection between real rotations in 2-dimensions and 1-dimensional rotations in the complex plane, represented by multiplication by unit-modulus complex numbers. Really not hugely surprizing once you get used to the idea of complex numbers, <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> having a square root, and all that. However, there is a bit of me that still finds it remarkable at 60+.</p>
<p>The group of 2-dimensional rotations is called SO(2), while the 1-dimensional complex rotation group is U(1), the 1-dimensional unitary group. Both these groups are parameterized by one variable, <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}\)</span> in our case.</p>
<p>If we had included the reflections, the rotation-reflection group would be O(2), the 2-dimensional orthogonal group. The complex analogue would be generated by complex conjugation (<span class="math inline">\(i\rightarrow-i\)</span>) and U(1)-rotations, which then becomes a bit of a mess, particularly if you want to use it in the context of analytic function theory.</p>
<p>For real <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}\in\mathbb R,\)</span> there is a mapping onto SO(2) and U(1) that respects addition in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R.\)</span> This is a result of the identity <span class="math inline">\(\exp(a+b)=\exp(a)\exp(b),\)</span> when the component objects <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> commute. This can be derived from Taylor series or products, along with limit arguments.</p>
<p>So we have <span class="math inline">\(\exp[(\omega_{12}+\omega&#39;_{12})\mathrm J^{12}]=\exp[(\omega_{12}\mathrm J^{12})\exp(\omega&#39;_{12}\mathrm J^{12}).\)</span></p>
<p>At this point we should notice that while there are group mappings (homomorphisms) from <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}\in\mathbb R\)</span> onto SO(2) or U(1) (<span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}\rightarrow \mathrm{SO(2)/U(1)}\)</span>), the reverse is not a mapping. Each element of the target groups correspond to an infinite number of values of <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}.\)</span> The <em>equivalent</em> values are separated by <span class="math inline">\(2\pi,\)</span> a complete turn, since the Euler exponential relation assumes we are using radians. In particular, the identity elements of SO(2)/U(1) are reached by integral multiples of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi,\)</span> which we can represent as <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\mathbb Z.\)</span></p>
<p>There are well known techniques for defining a quotient set where we divide out this <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\mathbb Z\)</span> ambiguity of the <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}\)</span> parameter to give a set of unique parameters for each element of SO(2)/U(1). This set is represented as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z.\)</span></p>
<p>The most common way in practice is to choose a set of representatives, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\{\omega_{12}:0\le \omega_{12}\lt 2\pi\}.\)</span> Now in this set we want addition to result in a value in this range. If the addition is less than <span class="math inline">\(2\pi,\)</span> we are done. Otherwise the addition is adjusted to drag the value back into the desired range by adding or subtracting integral multiples of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi.\)</span> Inverse elements are given by <span class="math inline">\(2\pi-\omega_{12}.\)</span></p>
<p>A more theoretical technique is to define a map <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z\)</span> where the elements of the target set are sets of <em>all</em> elements that map to a particular rotation/complex number. So if one parameter <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}\)</span> leads to a rotation/complex number, the corresponding element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}+2\pi\mathbb Z=\{\omega_{12}+2\pi k:k\in\mathbb Z\}.\)</span> Another notation for this <em>equivalence class</em> is <span class="math inline">\([\omega_{12}],\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}\)</span> is referred to as <em>a representative of the class</em>. In this context, addition is defined by addition of classes: <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}+\{b\}=\{a+b\}.\)</span> Some checks are needed to show that <span class="math inline">\([\omega_{12}]+[\omega&#39;_{12}]=[\omega_{12}+\omega&#39;_{12}],\)</span> but one finds that this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>The practical definition is just achieved through choosing a unique representative element of each equivalence class. Indeed for some applications, a more balanced range is used such as <span class="math inline">\(\{\omega_{12}:-\pi\lt \omega_{12}\le \pi\}.\)</span> Because we want to use the continuity of the groups, generally connected and continuous ranges are used, although this is not strictly necessary at this stage.</p>
<p>In abstract group theory, these observations are extended to mappings between general groups, resulting in a swathe of homomorphism and <em>isomorphism</em> theorems. In our case we note that our SO(2)/U(1) groups are effectively the same (isomorphic) as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z\)</span> with the defined addition. We express this as <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm {SO(2)}\cong\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z\cong\mathrm {U(1)}.\)</span> This is an equivalence relation, which also gives isomorphy of SO(2) and U(1).</p>
