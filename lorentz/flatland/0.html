<h2 id="flatland">Introduction</h2>
<p>We want to consider concrete examples of the rotation and Lorentx groups of two dimensional space or 1+1-dimensional space+time, resprectively. We begin by focusing on rotations; later we hope to transfer as much knowledge as possible to the Lorentz group, and maybe even describe the symplectic group. There are no one-dimensional rotations, only the reflection: <span class="math inline">\(x\rightarrow -x,\)</span> which is not connected continuously with the identity map.</p>
<p>As is often the case, there are some peculiarities with rotation groups of lower dimension. For 2-dimensional rotations, one of these peculiarities, we will find, is that the rotations commute, i.e. it is an “Abelian” group. This is not true in higher dimensions.</p>
<p>So let’s start by considering the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> parameter set: there is only one, <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}=-\omega_{21}.\)</span> The diagonal parameters are forced to be zero due to antisymmetry: \(\omega_{11}=-\omega_{11}\implies2\omega_{11}=0\implies\omega_{11}=0\) [assuming the algebraic field characteristic is not 2 — the real and complex numbers have characteristric 0]. The corresponding generator on two-dimensional space is: <span class="math display">\[(\mathrm J^{12})^i_j=\eta^{2i}\delta^1_j-\eta^{1i}\delta^2_j.\]</span></p>
<p>We often avoid matrix representations as not particularly helpful when there is a profusion of indices, but here we will define space vectors <span class="math inline">\(x^i\)</span> as column matrices. The superscript indexes the rows of the column. We take subscripts as indexing columns of the generators (and rotations).</p>
<p>Hence: <span class="math display">\[\mathrm J^{12}=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1\\-1&amp;0\end{pmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>An interesting observation comes with squaring the generator: <span class="math display">\[(\mathrm J^{12})^2=-\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}=-\mathrm I.\]</span></p>
<p>Relating <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm I\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, this is a bit like the imaginary square root of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i=\sqrt{-1}.\)</span> This gives a simple route to the exponential giving the rotation: <span class="math display">\[\mathrm R(\omega_{12})=\exp(\omega_{12}\mathrm J^{12})=\cos(\omega_{12})\mathrm I+\sin(\omega_{12})\mathrm J^{12}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\omega_{12})&amp;\sin(\omega_{12})\\-\sin(\omega_{12})&amp;\cos(\omega_{12})\end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>This is based on the Euler relation: <span class="math inline">\(\exp(i\theta)=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta).\)</span></p>
<p>I should also mention that we have collapsed <span class="math inline">\(\frac 1 2\omega_{ab}\mathrm J^{ab}=\frac 1 2(\omega_{12}\mathrm J^{12}+\omega_{21}\mathrm J^{21})=\omega_{12}\mathrm J^{12},\)</span> upon considering the antisymmetry of both <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm J\)</span> in the last term in the bracket. If one wanted to be finicky, there are also two terms in the implied sum of the far left of the series of equalities that are zero (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{11}\mathrm J^{11}=0\)</span>), also due to antisymmetry.</p>
<p>As it happens, the rotations are clockwise with increasing <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{12}.\)</span> This is in contrast to the usual representation of complex numbers. Choosing <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{21}\)</span> as the parameter would have given the opposite, more conventional result.</p>
<p>You may have heard/read (or not) that (finite, what about infinite?) Abelian group representations are one-dimensional. What does that mean here? The rotations here are acting on a two-dimensional space. This means it can be broken down into two complex one-dimensional representations.</p>
<p>In a sense this is standard if you know something about complex numbers. Rotations in the complex plane (Argand diagram) are represented by multiplications by unit-modulus complex numbers. This is what Euler’s relation is telling us.</p>
<p>In another sense this is one of the motivations I have for writing all this — it is the first appearance of one of the aspects I haven’t fully grasped: how real and complex representations of physical objects intertwine, most famously in the Wick rotation connection between 4-dimensional Euclidean space and (1+3)-dimensional Minkowski time+space of relativity. If you know better, answers in an email please.</p>
