## Joining the unitarians

We have seen that there is a close connection between real rotations in 2-dimensions and 1-dimensional rotations in the complex plane, represented by multiplication by unit-modulus complex numbers. Really not hugely surprizing once you get used to the idea of complex numbers, $-1$ having a square root, and all that. However, there is a bit of me that still finds it remarkable at 60+.

The group of 2-dimensional rotations is called SO(2), while the 1-dimensional complex rotation group is U(1), the 1-dimensional unitary group. Both these groups are parameterized by one variable, $\omega_{12}$ in our case.

If we had included the reflections, the rotation-reflection group would be O(2), the 2-dimensional orthogonal group. The complex analogue would be generated by complex conjugation ($i\rightarrow-i$) and U(1)-rotations, which then becomes a bit of a mess, particularly if you want to use it in the context of analytic function theory.

For real $\omega_{12}\in\mathbb R$, there is a mapping onto SO(2) and U(1) that respects addition in $\mathbb R$. This is a result of the identity $\exp(a+b)=\exp(a)\exp(b),$ when the component objects $a$ and $b$ commute. This can be derived from Taylor series or products, along with limit arguments.

So we have $\exp[(\omega_{12}+\omega'_{12})\mathrm J^{12}]=\exp[(\omega_{12}\mathrm J^{12})\exp(\omega'_{12}\mathrm J^{12})$.
