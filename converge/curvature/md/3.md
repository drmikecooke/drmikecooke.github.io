# Curvature

## Simple bending

We attempt to extract the “leading order” behaviour. If the $x$-direction is along the beam for small deformations we expect $x'=dx/dx_0\approx1$ and $y'\approx0$. We expand according to the “small” quantities $u=x'-1$ and $y'$. We find:

$$r'\approx 1+u+y'^2/2\approx1+u+\dots$$

$$(r''/r')^2-(\mathbf{r'.r''}/r'^2)^2\approx y''^2+\dots$$

Hence the strain energy is:

$$V\approx\int E \frac{Au^2+Iy''^2}{2}dx_0$$

Minimizing and integrating by parts in my head, I see that the differential equation in $y$ is fourth order. Suitable boundary conditions, I need to think about . . .

One would justify this brutal approach as being probably the best one could do in this context given the uncertainties of the applicability of the Euler-Bernoulli assumptions (Timoshenko, etc.).
