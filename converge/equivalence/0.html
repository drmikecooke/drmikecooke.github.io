    <h2>Same difference</h2>
    <p class="noindent">One of the mysteries of human thought and communication is how we conceptualize stuff. One of the key steps seems to me to be the ability to group things together and say that, for this or that purpose, we are going to regard this or that as the same. There are many thoughts, going back into the mists of time, on how this is possible, but I am not planning to get bogged down in that here. Instead, I will just describe a few ways to illustrate how mathematics is perhaps the ultimate expression of this way of thinking.</p>
    <p class="indent">Let us take the predicate “x is a dog”. Actually, “x” is a letter in the Latin/Roman alphabet, but we are using it here as a placeholder for “Fido”, “Spot”, “Rover”, or something more inventive/modern. In mathematical work, we might want to abbreviate the predicate, \(D(x)\) or, using a fancy letter to emphasize predicateness, \(\mathfrak D(x)\). Sometimes it is handy to drop the brackets: \(Dx\). or \(\mathfrak Dx\). I neither own, nor am owned by, a dog, so there is no object in my present vicinity that popped into this predicate makes it “true”. I occasionally see an object that does make it true, and the “dog” bit of my brain lights up. We can collect (in our heads) the things that make \(D/\mathfrak D\) “true” into a set using a notation like: \(\{x:Dx\}\). This notation is fraught with dangers, because there are objects that can be collected together in “sets” and others that can't. And the distinction depends on what flavour of set theory/logic is being used to avoid (at least) something called "Russell’s paradox”, which I may at some point describe. One common method is to only allow predicates to carve off sections of already defined sets. For dogs, one might push off the problems one step by considering the set of animals, \(A\), and carving off the dogs to give the set \(D=\{x\in A:\mathfrak Dx\}\), where \(x\in A\) means “\(x\) element of \(A\)”, so we are only collecting things in \(A\), which satisfy the doggishness predicate \(\mathfrak D\), using the capital letter for the set, and the fancy capital for the predicate.</p>
    <p class="indent">This is a step towards what I am trying to get at. However, it is not exactly. There is a (necessary) distinction between sets and their objects/elements. When our inner toddler points at an object and says “dog” in our head, we don't exactly have the set in mind. Rather we seem to have a series of predicates that are rather difficult to consciously pin down. “Usually, but not always, four legs”, for example. Or perhaps not even that: our toddler knows one when it sees one. In Plato’s works, Socrates or “strangers” from Athens (The Laws) or the Eleatic school (Sophist/Statesman) often search for the meaning of words by a process of “dichotomy” where defining properties/predicates are searched for. I don't remember a single one of these works issuing in a satisfactory outcome. Which may be the point.</p>
