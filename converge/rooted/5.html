    <h3>Cauchy sequences</h3>
    <p class="noindent">The Cauchy approach is closer to the way convergence is typically presented in mathematics. A rational <em>Cauchy sequence</em> is an infinite list of rational numbers that gets closer and closer to the target real number. There are other Cauchy sequences of different objects, which we will come to later.</p>
    <p class="indent">Let us denote the list \(\{a_n\}:=a_0,a_1,a_2, \dots\). How do we represent “closer and closer”? Traditionally, an “epsilon” symbol \(\epsilon\) is used to represent a small-as-you-like number greater than 0. At this stage, we will insist that \(\epsilon\) is also rational \(\epsilon\in\mathbb Q\). If the list items get closer and closer as \(n\rightarrow\infty\), there is a positive integer \(N\in\mathbb Z^+\) such that \(\forall (m,n\gt N)(|a_m-a_n|\lt\epsilon)\). Our two methods for calculating \(\sqrt 2\) produced (at least in principle for the binary search method) Cauchy sequences. But notice the actual sequences for \(\sqrt 2\) were different. Further there are, as mentioned earlier, many more ways to calculate approximations/Cauchy sequences for \(\sqrt 2\), or any other real number. So how can we use such seuqences to represent real numbers, particularly the irrational ones that are missing from \(\mathbb Q\)?</p>
    <p class="indent">Let us first focus on the Cauchy sequences that converge to 0. The simplest is \(\{a_n\}=0,0,0,\dots\), but there are others such as \(\{a_n\}=1,1/2,1/3,\dots,1/(n+1),\dots\) and \(\{a_n\}=5,-5/4,5/16,\dots,5/(-4)^n,\dots\) , and you no doubt could add many more. An infinite number in fact. The zero Cauchy sequences are distinguished by the fact that there is a further restriction: \(\forall(\epsilon\gt 0)\exists(N\in\mathbb Z^+)\forall(n>N)(|a_n|<\epsilon)\). We want to declare that all these zero Cauchy sequences are “the same”. The way this is commonly done is to collect all the different zero sequences up into a set and declared that the result <em>is</em> the real number 0. We will see later how we can use any of the component Cauchy sequence of real 0 to represent it if necessary.</p>
    <p class="indent">How about the non-zero Cauchy sequences? We use a similar tactic: we equate/collect together sequences that differ by a zero sequence. In symbols, \(\{a_n-b_n\}\in 0\in\mathbb R\). It is fairly easy to prove that the difference of two Cauchy sequences is also Cauchy.</p>
    <p class="indent">Let us now consider how the rationals fit into the scheme. If \(q\in\mathbb Q\), let us represent the simplest Cauchy sequence as \(\{q\}\) and the corresponding collection of equivalent sequences \([\{q\}]\in \mathbb R\). We extend this to general Cauchy sequences \([\{a_n\}]\in \mathbb R\). These square bracketed entities are called “equivalence classes”, a ubiquitous concept that we plan to explore more fully later.</p>
    <p class="indent">We have already stated that differences of Cauchy sequences, defined in the obvious way, are Cauchy. The same goes for sums and products, which allows us to define: \[[\{a_n\}]+[\{a_n\}]:=[\{a_n+b_n\}]\] and \[[\{a_n\}][\{a_n\}]:=[\{a_nb_n\}]\]</p>
    <p class="indent">Division is trickier due to the need to exclude division by 0. General Cauchy sequences representing non-zero reals may include some zero terms, but so long as the quotient is non-zero, one can always choose a representative without zero terms, allowing a similar definition.</p>
    <p class="indent">Finally, we note that one can easily define a greater than relation, and even Cauchy sequences of real numbers. However, <em>all</em> real Cauchy sequences can be shown to converge to a real number, avoiding the need to repeat the process above. Also this completeness of the reals with respect to Cauchy sequences implies the least upper bound property as described for Dedekind cuts. We plan to expand on these aspects later.</p>
