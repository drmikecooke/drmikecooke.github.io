    <h3>Cauchy sequences</h3>
    <p class="noindent">The Cauchy approach is closer to the way convergence is typically presented in mathematics. A rational <em>Cauchy sequence</em> is an infinite list of rational numbers that gets closer and closer to the target real number. There are other Cauchy sequences of different objects, which we will come to later.</p>
    <p class="indent">Let us denote the list \(\{a_n\}:=a_0,a_1,a_2, \dots\). How do we represent “closer and closer”? Traditionally, an “epsilon” symbol \(\epsilon\) is used to represent a small-as-you-like number greater than 0. At this stage, we will insist that \(\epsilon\) is also rational \(\epsilon\in\mathbb Q\). If the list items get closer and closer as \(n\rightarrow\infty\), there is a positive integer \(N\in\mathbb Z^+\) such that \(\forall (m,n\gt N)(|a_m-a_n|\lt\epsilon)\). Our two methods for calculating \(\sqrt 2\) produced (at least in principle for the binary search method) Cauchy sequences. But notice the actual sequences for \(\sqrt 2\) were different. Further there are, as mentioned earlier, many more ways to calculate approximations/Cauchy sequences for \(\sqrt 2\), or any other real number. So how can we use such sequences to represent real numbers, particularly the irrational ones that are missing from \(\mathbb Q\)?</p>
    <p class="indent">Let us first focus on the Cauchy sequences that converge to 0. The simplest is \(\{a_n\}=0,0,0,\dots\), but there are others such as \(\{a_n\}=1,1/2,1/3,\dots,1/(n+1),\dots\) and \(\{a_n\}=5,-5/4,5/16,\dots,5/(-4)^n,\dots\) , and you no doubt could add many more. An infinite number in fact. The zero Cauchy sequences are distinguished by the fact that there is a further restriction: \(\forall(\epsilon\gt 0)\exists(N\in\mathbb Z^+)\forall(n>N)(|a_n|<\epsilon)\). We want to declare that all these zero Cauchy sequences are “the same”. The way this is commonly done is to collect all the different zero sequences up into a set and declared that the result <em>is</em> the real number 0. We will see later how we can use any of the component Cauchy sequence of (the Cauchy version of) real 0 to represent it if necessary.</p>
    <p class="indent">How about the non-zero Cauchy sequences? We use a similar tactic: we equate/collect together sequences that differ by a zero sequence. In symbols, \(\{a_n-b_n\}\in 0\in\mathbb R\). It is fairly easy to prove that the difference of two Cauchy sequences is also Cauchy.</p>
    <p class="indent">Let us now consider how the rationals fit into the scheme. If \(q\in\mathbb Q\), let us represent the simplest Cauchy sequence as \(\{q\}\) and the corresponding collection of equivalent sequences \([\{q\}]\in \mathbb R\). We extend this to general Cauchy sequences \([\{a_n\}]\in \mathbb R\). These square bracketed entities are called “equivalence classes”, a ubiquitous concept that we plan to explore more fully later.</p>
    <p class="indent">We have already stated that differences of Cauchy sequences, defined in the obvious way, are Cauchy. The same goes for sums and products, which allows us to define: \[[\{a_n\}]+[\{a_n\}]:=[\{a_n+b_n\}]\] and \[[\{a_n\}][\{a_n\}]:=[\{a_nb_n\}]\]</p>
    <p class="indent">Division is trickier due to the need to exclude division by 0. General Cauchy sequences representing non-zero reals may include some zero terms, but so long as the quotient is non-zero, one can always choose a representative without zero terms, allowing a similar definition.</p>
    <p class="indent">Finally, we note that one can easily define a greater than relation, and even Cauchy sequences of real numbers. However, <em>all</em> real Cauchy sequences can be shown to converge to a real number, avoiding the need to repeat the process above. One way to do this is first to show the least upper bound property, and then derive that Cauchy sequences of reals converge. (There are also ways to start from Cauchy convergence and derive least upper bounds.)</p>
    <p class="indent">The least upper bound property can be derived in a similar way to \(\sqrt 2\). As part of the least upper bound property, we are given a set of “numbers” and an upper bound. At least notionally, we can determine if a number is an upper bound of the set or not. Our upper bound consists of a set of rationals, and if we search along the sequence, one of these will be an upper bound of the given set. Similarly, we can use one of the elements of the given set we are looking for a least upper bound to find a rational that is <em>not</em> a least upper bound. Notice we are sliding back and forth between the reals and rationals here, and in a rigorous proof this would need to be justified. Anyway, we can narrow in on our least upper bound in the same way we did for \(\sqrt 2\), for example, taking the half-way point between our rational upper and <em>not</em> upper bounds and testing if the result is or not an upper bound. If we continue in this way and collect the rational numbers in a suitable sequence, we find that it is Cauchy, and in fact (a representative of) the least upper bound. This number may or may not be in the original set.</p>
