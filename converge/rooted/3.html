    <h2>Realizing root 2</h2>
    <p class="noindent">On the previous pages, we have calculated rational approximations to \(\sqrt 2\), which in principle can be continued forever, if one could be bothered. There are better ways (i.e. faster to get closer) to do this, based on various methods such as “the Secant Method” or one reported many moons ago by Newton-Raphson.</p>
    <p class="indent">This raises questions of how we can work with these objects that are not rational, but can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers?</p>
    <p class="indent">The so-called real number system (\(\mathbb R\)) does this. This can be defined abstractly using axioms, or “constructively” from sets of (or sets of sets of) rational numbers.</p>
    <p class="indent">One constructive approach is to use decimal representations (we have shown one way to generate this for \(\sqrt 2\)). For most real numbers, the representation is infinitely long. In fact, the numbers with terminating decimal representations also have an infinite representation, which for theoretical purposes is often preferred. For example, \(2=1.999999\dots\) or \(100=99.9999\dots\) — the non-terminating versions can be shown to get as close as you like to the terminating version. The rule is to drop the last figure by 1 (with carry through if necessary, as for 100), and fill out the rest with 9s. It is fairly easy to see what addition, multiplication, greater/less than and so on look like in this expanded context.</p>
    <p class="indent">I will briefly describe two more theoretical, but “constructive” approaches attached to the names of two greats of the 19th century: Dedekind and Cauchy.</p>
