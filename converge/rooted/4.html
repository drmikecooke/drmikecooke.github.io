    <h3>Dedekind cuts</h3>
    <p class="noindent">I start with Dedekind’s version, as being slightly easier to comprehend, with real numbers consisting of sets of rational numbers, rather than sets of sets (Cauchy).</p>
    <p class="indent">A “Dedekind cut” consists of splitting the set of rational numbers (\(\mathbb Q\)) into two non-empty sets, \(A\) and \(B\) (i.e. \(A \cup B=\mathbb Q, A \cap B=\varnothing\)), with all the numbers of \(A\) less than those of \(B.\) Further \(A\) does not contain a greatest element. If we just focus on \(A\), and using logical abbreviations (\(\forall\) “for all”, \(\land\) “and”, \(\implies\) “implies”/“if . . . then . . .”):</p>
    <div class="center">
      <ol style="display:inline-block;text-align:left;">
        <li>\(A\neq \mathbb Q,\varnothing\).</li>
        <li>\(\forall (x,y \in \mathbb Q)(x\lt y \land y \in A \implies x \in A)\)</li>
        <li>\(\forall (x \in A)\exists(y\in A)(y\gt x)\)</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="indent">In the case of \(\sqrt 2\), the set \(A=\{x \in \mathbb Q: x^2\lt 2\}\cup\{x \in \mathbb Q: x\lt 0\}\) satisfies these conditions. In essence \(A\) is \(\{x\in \mathbb Q: x\lt \sqrt2\}\), except that if you are trying to define \(\sqrt 2\) by a Dedekind cut, one best not include its symbol in the definition, to avoid circularity.</p>
    <p class="indent">The constuction continues by defining concepts of ordering and the arithmetic of addition and multiplication. If the set \(A_1\) of one Dedekind cut is a subset of another \(A_2\) (\(A_1\subset A_2\)) the corresponding “real numbers" are ordered \(a_1\lt a_2\). Defining, as common in group theory, \(A_1+A_2=\{x+y:x\in A_1,y\in A_2\}\), one finds the resulting set to be (the “\(A\)” part of) a Dedkind cut. The same goes for set multiplication: \(A_1A_2=\{xy:x\in A_1,y\in A_2\}.\)</p>
    <p class="indent">One now comes to the upshot of the effort: “Dedekind completeness”. The simplest expression of this is the “least upper bound” property from which many other consequences result. An upper bound of a set of objects, \(S\) is an element such that \(\forall(s\in S)(x\ge s).\) This assumes, of course, that \(\ge\) is an ordering relation on the objects in \(S\) and \(x\). In the case of Dedekind cuts, the set \(B\) contains all the upper bounds of \(A\). Sometimes the set \(B\) has a least element, sometimes it doesn’t. If there is a least element of \(B\), it is a least upper bound of \(A\). The Dedekind cut corresponding to the rational number 2, has \(2\in B\), so 2 is then the least upper bound of the corresponding \(A\). By contrast an irrational cut, like that for \(\sqrt 2\), has \((A,B)\) without a least element in \(B\), since \(\sqrt 2\notin\mathbb Q\).</p>
    <p class="indent">But the set of upper bounds of a bounded set of Dedekind cuts (\(\mathscr D=\{(A_i,B_i)\}\)), does have a least element. One has to exclude unbounded sets, to avoid ending up with \(A=\mathbb Q\), which is <em>not</em> a cut. But when bounded, one can take the cut defined by \(A=\bigcup_iA_i\), which is the union of all the \(A_i\) sets. DeMorgan’s theorem connecting unions and intersections of sets and complements gives the complementary partner \(B=\bigcap_iB_i\), the intersection of all the \(B_i\).</p>
    <p class="indent">A totally ordered system has the least upper bound property, if every bounded subset has a least upper bound. Dedekind cuts have this property, and if as I have loosely suggested each Dedekind cut can be uniquely associated with a real number, then the set of reals \((\mathbb R)\) has the same property.</p>
