# Gamma function

## ln &Gamma; &mdash; product to sum

The product formula enables more development. In particular, taking the logarithm of the $\Gamma$ function converts it into a sum. Further, we hope to show that the sum can be expressed in simpler functions and an integral. This will be achieved using Euler-Maclaurin formulas.

To begin this, we start with:
$$\Gamma(z)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{n!n^z}{\prod\limits_{m=0}^n(z+m)}$$

Taking the logarithm:
$$\ln\Gamma(z)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}z\ln(n)-\ln(z)+\sum\limits_{m=1}^n[\ln(m)-\ln(m+z)]$$
For now, we restrict ourselves to considering only $\mathrm{Re}(z)\gt0$ to avoid the singularities at $z=0,-1,\dots$ Also, we choose the ‘Riemann sheet’ where the logarithm is real on the real axis. The first term in the sum comes from the factorial, $n!$, and the second term from the denominator product, apart from one factor of $z$.
