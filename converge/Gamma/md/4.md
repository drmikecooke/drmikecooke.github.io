# Gamma function

## Digamma

The digamma function $\psi$ is the derivative of $\ln\Gamma(z)$:

$$\psi(z)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\ln(n)-\sum\limits_{m=0}^n\frac{1}{(m+z)}$$

The sum can be transformed into an integral using:
$$\sum\limits_{m=0}^n\frac{1}{(m+z)}=\sum\limits_{m=0}^n\int\limits_0^\infty\exp(-[m+z]t)dt$$
Since the sum is finite we can perform it first, inside the integral:
$$\int\limits_0^\infty\sum\limits_{m=0}^n\exp(-[m+z]t)dt=\int\limits_0^\infty\exp(-zt)\sum\limits_{m=0}^n\exp(-mt)dt$$
The sum can be seen to be geometric, and therefore we get:
$$\int\limits_0^\infty\exp(-zt)\frac{1-\exp(-
[n+1]t)}{1-\exp(-t)}dt$$
Combining with our logarithmic interlude:
$$\psi(z)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{\exp(-t)-\exp(-tn)}t- \\ \exp(-zt)\frac{1-\exp(-
[n+1]t)}{1-\exp(-t)}dt$$
For $\mathrm{Re}(z)>0$, all the integrals converge as $t\rightarrow\infty$. However, the $t\rightarrow0$ limit is more ticklish.
As the integral stands, the integrand consists of two components that tend to finite limits at $t=0$. The bit from the logarithmic interlude tends to $n-1$ and that from the sum to $-(n+1)$. We note that the combination tends to $-2$. We want to rearrange the integrand to parts that tend to finite values as $t\rightarrow0$ and $n\rightarrow\infty$.
We propose:
$$\psi(z)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\limits_0^\infty\left[\frac{\exp(-t)}t-\frac{\exp(-zt)}{1-\exp(-t)}\right]+ \\ \left[\frac{\exp(-
[z+n+1]t)}{1-\exp(-t)}-\frac{\exp(-nt)}t\right]dt$$
We note that the first bracket does not depend on $n$. The second bracket looks as if it will tend to zero as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Hooray! The integral of the first bracket will be our (first?) integral form.

To show that this partition is meaningful, we need the Bernoulli expansion:
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac t{1-\exp(-t)} &= \frac{t\exp(t)}{\exp(t)-1} \\ &=B_0(1)+B_1(1)t+O(t^2) \\ &=1+\frac12t+O(t^2)
\end{aligned} $$

Using the Bernoulli expansion, we find that as $t\rightarrow0$, $n$-independent bracket tends to $z-3/2$. The $n$-dependent limit is $-z-1/2$. Adding these together gives $-2$, as before.

We look at the $n$-dependent part:
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\limits_0^\infty\left[\frac{\exp(-
[z+n+1]t)}{1-\exp(-t)}-\frac{\exp(-tn)}t\right]dt$$
We can rearrange:
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\limits_0^\infty\exp(-nt)\left[\frac{\exp(-zt)}{\exp(t)-1}-\frac{1}t\right]dt$$

From the well known inequality $\exp(t)-1\ge t$ we deduce that positive first term in the bracket is always less than the term after the minus sign. The bracket is thus always less than zero. It also tends to zero as $t\rightarrow\infty$. The bracket is clearly continuous on $(0,\infty)$. We can extend the continuity to 0, where the bracket tends to $-z-1/2$ by a previous argument. The function is therefore bounded on $[0,1]$, and for $(1,\infty)$ is in the range $(-1,0)$. So the bracket is bounded below by some constant $-K$. This allows us to show:
$$\begin{aligned}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left|\int\limits_0^\infty\exp(-nt)\left[\frac{\exp(-zt)}{\exp(t)-1}-\frac{1}t\right]dt\right|&\lt \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int\limits_0^\infty\exp(-nt)Kdt\\&=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac K n=0
\end{aligned}$$

We can now assert:
$$\psi(z)=\int\limits_0^\infty\left[\frac{\exp(-t)}t-\frac{\exp(-zt)}{1-\exp(-t)}\right]dt$$
a formula derived by Gauss.
