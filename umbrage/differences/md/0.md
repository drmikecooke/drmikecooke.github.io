# Difference operators

## Intro

 Difference operators are usual defined in terms of translation operator. We use a unit step difference, often denoted $h=1$. Other step sizes can be accomodated through scaling $x$.

 There are three main types of difference operators:

 Backward: $\nabla=\mathbb1-T^{-1}$

 Central: $\delta=T^{1/2}-T^{-1/2}$

 Forward: $\Delta=T^1-\mathbb1$

 For interpolation, and other numerical analysis problems such as solving differential equations, we actually want to find $T^a$ in terms of these difference operators.
