# Difference operators

## Central


The central difference operator $\delta=T^{+1/2}-T^{-1/2}$ is not as tractable. I have been unable to get an elegant formulation. Rather I have worked up from the small order convolution-type basic polynomials to be able to guess from there the sequence with the property:

$$\delta q_n=q_{n-1}$$

starting from $q_0(x)=1$ and $q_n(0)=0$, $n>1$.

We know that $q_1$ is linear in $x$, $q_1(0)=0$, and $\delta q_1=q_0=1$. In fact, these factors determine that $q_1(x)=x$.

Moving to $q_2$, a quadratic without constant term such that $\delta q_2=q_1=x$. We note that $\delta x^2=2x=2q_1$. This gives $q_2(x)=x^2/2$.

For $q_3$, it is useful to know $\delta x^3=3x^2+1/4$. This gives $q_3(x)=x(x^2-1/4)/3!$.

For me the penny dropped when I calculated $q_4$. From $\delta x^4=4x^3+x$, I determined that $q_4(x)=(x^4-x^2)/4!$.

To get the general formula it is useful to remember $x^2-b^2=(x+b)(x-b)$ to factorize:

$$q_3(x)=x(x+1/2)(x-1/2)/3!$$

$$q_4(x)=x^2(x+1)(x-1)$$

This suggests a general formula with product of integral steps between half-integral limits, and taking the value as 1 for an empty range (i.e. for $k=1$):

$$q_k(x)=\frac x{k!}\prod\limits_{n=-(k-2)/2}^{+(k-2)/2}(x+n)$$

The $x/k!$ part takes care of the condition $q_k(0)=0$. We need to check $\delta q_k=q_{k-1}$. We note:

$$q_k(x+1/2)=\frac {x+1/2}{k!}\prod\limits_{n=-(k-3)/2}^{+(k-1)/2}(x+n)$$

$$q_k(x-1/2)=\frac {x-1/2}{k!}\prod\limits_{n=-(k-1)/2}^{+(k-3)/2}(x+n)$$

Extracting the common factors:

$$\begin{aligned}
\delta q_k(x)=&\frac1{k!}[(x+(k-1)/2)(x+1/2)- \\
&(x-(k-1)/2)(x-1/2)]\prod\limits_{n=-(k-3)/2}^{+(k-3)/2}(x+n)\end{aligned}$$

The square bracket works out at $kx$, giving $\delta q_k=q_{k-1}$.

Some people define a pseudo-power notation, $q_k(x)=x^{[k]}/k!$.
