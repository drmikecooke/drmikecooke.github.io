# Difference operators

## Forward

The expression for the forward difference (less useful since it needs more and more data from the “future”) is $\Delta=T^1-\mathbb1$. Hence:

$$\exp(D)=T=1+\Delta$$

And so:

$$p(n+x)=[(1+\Delta)^xp](n)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \binom xk [\Delta^kp](n)$$

Therefore the basic sequence of polynomials for $\Delta$ are:

$$q_k(x)=\binom xk$$

Again $q_0(x)=1$. A more explicit representation is:

$$q_k(x)=\frac1{k!}\prod\limits_{n=0}^{k-1}(x-n)$$

A calculation shows $\Delta q_k=q_{k-1}$.
