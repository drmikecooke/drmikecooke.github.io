<p>We want to show the sequence in:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lim_{N\to+\infty}e_{N}=\lim_{N\to+\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{N}\right)^{N}\]</span></p>
<p>is monotonic increasing for <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;0\)</span>. As a bonus we want to also show that <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{N\to-\infty}e_{N}\)</span> is monotonic decreasing for <span class="math inline">\(N&lt;-1\)</span>, along with <span class="math inline">\(e_{-N}&gt;e_{M}\)</span> for all positive <span class="math inline">\(N,M\)</span>. Finally we want to show that both limits go the same finite number. The numbers <span class="math inline">\(N=0,-1\)</span> are pathological, giving <span class="math inline">\(e_{0}=+\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_{-1}=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>None of these statements is obvious (except for the exceptions) first off: for example, the size of the factors <span class="math inline">\((1+1/N)\)</span> decrease as <span class="math inline">\(N\to+\infty\)</span>, but there are more of them. We can bring to bear stuff we “know” from school or university, but then we have to ask “How do we know?” Some of this “knowledge” includes features of the behaviour of powers (or logarithms) that we want to prove.</p>
<p>We can use the binomial formula to break the problem down a bit:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(a+b\right)^{N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}a^{n}b^{N-n}{N \choose n}\]</span></p>
<p>The binomial factor is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{N \choose n}=\frac{N!}{n!\left(N-n\right)!}\]</span></p>
<p>is the number of ways of choosing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>s and <span class="math inline">\(N-n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>s from the brackets. <span>[</span><span class="math inline">\(n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots1.\)</span><span>]</span> This can be shown fairly easily using inductive arguments, and elementary properties of multiplication and addition.</p>
<p>So we have (swapping <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N-n\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e_{N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)^{n}1^{N-n}{N \choose n}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)^{n}{N \choose n}\]</span></p>
<p>The first two terms turn out to be both 1, so they are constant for <span class="math inline">\(N\to+\infty\)</span>. The third term is <span class="math inline">\(\left(N-1\right)/\left(2N\right)=\left(1/2\right)\left(1-1/N\right)\)</span>, which approaches 1/2 from below (i.e. is monotonic increasing). Although this is a good start, obviously to consider each term in this way would take from here to eternity. Let us define:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e_{N}^{\left(n\right)}=\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)^{n}{N \choose n}\]</span></p>
<p>Separating out the binomial factor:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e_{N}^{\left(n\right)}=\frac{1}{n!}\prod_{m=0}^{n}\frac{N-m}{N}=\frac{1}{n!}\prod_{m=1}^{n}\frac{N-m}{N}=\frac{1}{n!}\prod_{m=1}^{n}\left(1-\frac{m}{N}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>This is a product of terms that increase towards 1. The m=0 term was removed since it was (already) 1. Hence the <span class="math inline">\(e_{N}\)</span> increase with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we can’t transfer this analysis straight away to negative <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> since the binomial expansion is infinite (and not at this stage obviously true). However we can cast the negative values to positive using:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e_{-N}=\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)^{-N}=\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{-N}=\left(\frac{N}{N-1}\right)^{N}=\frac{N}{N-1}\left(1+\frac{1}{N-1}\right)^{N-1}=\frac{N}{N-1}e_{N-1}\]</span></p>
<p>While interesting, this result isn’t much use at this point, although it does tell us that <span class="math inline">\(e_{-N}&gt;e_{N-1}\)</span>. Let’s look instead at:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{N}=\frac{1}{e_{-N}}=\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)^{N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left(\frac{-1}{N}\right)^{n}{N \choose n}=1-1+\frac{N-1}{2N}-\frac{\left(N-1\right)\left(N-2\right)}{6N^{2}}+\ldots=\frac{N^{2}-1}{3N^{2}}+\ldots\]</span></p>
<p>If we can show that this increases with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> we will then have that <span class="math inline">\(e_{N}\)</span> decreases. We have paired the positive and negative terms to give zero and a number that increases to 1/3 as <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> increases, which is promising for the project.</p>
<p>Working in more generalised terms:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{2N+1}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left(\left(\frac{-1}{2N+1}\right)^{2n}{2N+1 \choose 2n}+\left(\frac{-1}{2N+1}\right)^{2n+1}{2N+1 \choose 2n+1}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>After some hard mathematical graft, I compressed this a bit to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{2N+1}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left(2n\left(\frac{1}{2N+1}\right)^{2n+1}{2N+2 \choose 2n+1}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>You may have noticed that I have missed out the even <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. In that case there are an odd number of terms. Adding in the extra (positive) term gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{2N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\left(2n\left(\frac{1}{2N}\right)^{2n+1}{2N+1 \choose 2n+1}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2N}\right)^{2N}\]</span></p>
<p>We also notice that the <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> term is zero, and can therefore be omitted from consideration. Let us define:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{N}^{(n)}=2n\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)^{2n+1}{N+1 \choose 2n+1}\]</span></p>
<p>These expressions mean that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{2N}=\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}f_{2N}^{(n)}+\left(\frac{1}{2N}\right)^{2N}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{2N+1}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}f_{2N+1}^{(n)}\]</span></p>
<p>Let us unpack:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{N}^{(n)}=\frac{2n}{\left(2n+1\right)!}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)^{2n+1}\prod_{m=0}^{2n}\left(N+1-m\right)=\frac{2n}{\left(2n+1\right)!}\prod_{m=0}^{2n}\frac{N+1-m}{N}\]</span></p>
<p>All the terms in the final product increase with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> except for the <span class="math inline">\(m=0,1\)</span> terms. However the <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span> term can be combined with the <span class="math inline">\(m=2\)</span> term, while the <span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span> term is 1, neither increasing or decreasing the product:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{N}^{(n)}=\frac{2n}{\left(2n+1\right)!}\frac{N^{2}-1}{N^{2}}\prod_{m=3}^{2n}\frac{N+1-m}{N}\]</span></p>
<p>The combined <span class="math inline">\(m=0,2\)</span> term is also increasing with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>The only niggle left is whether the combination of the last two terms might decrease relative to the previous single term. However, one finds that in fact the worry about the behaviour of the final terms can be lifted by considering:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{2N}^{(N)}=2N\left(\frac{1}{2N}\right)^{2N+1}{2N+1 \choose 2N+1}=\left(\frac{1}{2N}\right)^{2N}\]</span></p>
<p>So in fact:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{2N}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}f_{2N}^{(n)}\]</span></p>
<p>and the neighbouring series are comparable, including the last odd term, if present.</p>
<p>So what do we know so far? First, for <span class="math inline">\(N,m&gt;0\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(e_{N+m}&gt;e_{N}\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(e_{-\left(N+m\right)}&lt;e_{-N}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(N&gt;1\)</span>). As noted above <span class="math inline">\(e_{-N}&gt;e_{N-1}\)</span>. We can now extend this to <span class="math inline">\(e_{-N}&gt;e_{-\left(N+m\right)}&gt;e_{N+m-1}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(e_{N}\)</span> is an increasing sequence, this means that all <span class="math inline">\(e_{-N}\)</span> are greater than all <span class="math inline">\(e_{M}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(e_{-N}&gt;e_{M}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span>). Any e_{-N} bounds above the increasing monotonic sequence e_M. Similarly any <span class="math inline">\(e_{M}\)</span> bounds the decreasing sequence <span class="math inline">\(e_{-N}\)</span> from below. The other bound is given by the first terms in the sequences. These features enable us to say that the sequences tend towards unique numbers (rather than increasing or decreasing forever, wandering off to positive or negative infinity). Although the sequences are made up of rational numbers, the limits may not be (and in fact are not). The real numbers were invented to enable such sequences to be dealt with coherently. Further the limits of the sequences lead to the <em>same</em> number. This follows from (since the extra factor tends to 1):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e_{-N}=\frac{N}{N-1}e_{N-1}\]</span></p>
<p>There are a bewildering number of ways to define real numbers from the rationals, the two main ones being Cauchy sequences and Dedekind cuts. These eventually lead to things like the “bounded monotone covergence theorem” used above.</p>
