I plan to go into more detail concerning the power and log relation,
since I guess my Logjam effort was too compact in this area.

So let's start by examining the powers of a ``base'' b up to, and
just beyond, 10:

We have chosen to go up to 10, because our aim is to get an estimate
of the logarithms to base 10. If we were looking for logs to base
2, we would have cut off there instead. The length of the list depends
on how close your base is to 1. The size of the base does not matter,
except that the closer to 1, the more accurate our estimates will
be.

Now to get logs to base 10, from our base b calculations we need:

\[
\log_{10}x=\frac{\log_{b}x}{\log_{b}10}
\]

Now the logs to base b are found by reversing the table, where our
log is the ``n'' value for a given ``x'' ($b^{n}$):

If you choose $b=1.1$ you will find $\log_{b}10$ is somewhere between
24 and 25. Going to $b=1.01$, you find a $\log_{b}10$ between 231
and 232. Unless you are very careful, it is unlikely that your $\log_{b}10$
is going to be a whole number (or even close to one). We could try
fine-tuning the base, but then what about other values of $\log_{b}x$?
Rather we assume that $\log_{b}10$ and $\log_{b}x$ lie on the straight
lines between adjoining points.

With $b=1.1$, we have $\left(x,\log_{b}x\right)$ values of $\left(9.84\ldots,24\right)$
and $\left(10.83\ldots,25\right)$. The straight line going through
these points has the formula:

\[
\log_{b}x\thickapprox24\frac{x-10.83\ldots}{9.84\ldots-10.83\ldots}+25\frac{x-9.84\ldots}{10.83\ldots-9.84\ldots}
\]

This form should make it fairly easy to convince yourself in your
head that when $x=9.84\ldots$ we have $\log_{b}x=24$, and the same
for the other target value. The formula can be rearranged:

\[
\log_{b}x\thickapprox\frac{25\left(x-9.84\ldots\right)-24\left(x-10.83\ldots\right)}{10.83\ldots-9.84\ldots}=\frac{x-25\left(9.84\ldots\right)+24\left(10.83\ldots\right)}{10.83\ldots-9.84\ldots}
\]

Inserting $x=10$, one finds $\log_{b}x\thickapprox24.1525\ldots$.
A more accurate computer calculated value is $\log_{b}x\thickapprox24.1588\ldots$.
Using the points closest to the integers up to 10, we use similar
``linear interpolation'' to derive an estimate to the table (and
for other $x$ values if desired):
