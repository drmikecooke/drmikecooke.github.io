  <h2>Logjam 4: Compound uselessness</h2>
    <div class="standard">Elsewhere [<a href="../Power/Power.html">Powering<sup>up</sup></a>] I have elaborated how compound interest arises and how it relates to exponential behaviour. Here I will look at problems such as: If I want a 30% yield on an investment after 10 years, what sort of annual interest rate should I set or seek? In mathematical terms we a looking for a solution <em>x</em> to:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left( {1 + x} \right)^{10} = 1 + 30 = 1.3\] </div>

    <div class="indent">Well you could just try a series of values for <em>x</em>, hopefully using ones intelligence to get closer and closer. This is called “shooting”, and is a respectable method in the absence of anything better. As part of shooting you might apply a bracketing method along with some interpolation, guessing lower and upper bounds (1%? and 3%) and zeroing in.</div>
    <div class="indent">However, here logarithms can save us all that. We have from applying logarithms to both sides:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left. 10\log\left( {1 + x} \right) = \log 1.3\Longrightarrow\log\left( {1 + x} \right) = \frac{\log 1.3}{10} \right.\] </div>

    <div class="indent">Antilogging in whatever base gives:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[1 + x = 1.02658\ldots\] </div>

    <div class="indent">So the desired interest rate would be around 2.7%, not much different from the upper bound of 3%. However, the difference is more significant if you want to double your money — i.e. 100% yield:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left. \log\left( {1 + x} \right) = \frac{\log 2}{10}\Longrightarrow 1 + x = 1.0718 \right.\] </div>

    <div class="indent">You can reduce the annual rate to 7.2%, rather than the naive 100%/10=10%. For a bank’s PR/advertising, this looks far less menacing to the intended victims.</div>
