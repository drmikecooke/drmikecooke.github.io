    <h1>Logjam</h1>
    <div class="noindent">I was once sitting in a pub talking to a woman who was proud not to understand mathematics and decried an education system that required her to study it at school and a particular example she chose of useless knowledge was logarithms (or “logs”). She claimed (I expect she still does) that nobody uses them except for passing exams. I often think of this, and on a immediate level I am kind of annoyed with myself that I just listened and didn’t come up with examples of their practical use, such as for deriving and working with compound growth/interest rates and such (see below).</div>
    <div class="indent">This was from an ordinary person, but I suspect many from the high-arty and humanities side of the upper echelons of life would agree with the spirit of what she was saying. “We’ve had enough of ‘experts’,” as one UK politician famously said during the Brexit referendum. [This may be an England thing, where there is a certain culture of celebrating contempt for and ignorance of science and engineering, also known as STEM (“science, technology, engineering, and mathematics”).] In the present 2020 Covid pandemic the complaint is often made that graphs presented with a log-scale “don’t give the real picture”. Not quite as sweeping as “nobody uses them”, but in the same spiritual space. Yet what is often not realised is that in many cases our real experience is of multiplication factors, and logarithms are a perfect way of translating that to our linear visual perception. Let’s just mention hearing — musical pitch relates notes an octave apart; an octave means a factor of 2 in frequency of the pressure oscillation we perceive as “sound”. Further, our loudness perception is measured in “decibels”, a logarithmic scale.</div>

    </figure>

    <div class="indent">I guess another level of self-annoyance with the pub experience is that mathematics doesn’t need to be defended on purely utilitarian grounds. Not that it can’t make that case (our interaction with electronics devices is packed with mathematical knowledge constantly running in the background as you watch your cat videos). No, mathematics is just as much part of human culture as poetry and the visual arts. After all, writing arose from the accounting needs of complex (probably oppressive) societies. That is, from the dawn of history. Of course, poetry and visual art reach back further into pre-history in oral traditions, and cave and rock paintings and scratchings. I suspect primitive mathematical concepts like number and shape do too.</div>

    <h2>1 So what are logarithms?</h2>
    <div class="standard">From the Covid example given above, one could say that logarithms straighten out exponential behavior, so that a log-scale graph of an exponential process appears as a straight line. This is useful for distinguishing such behavior from others such as quadratic, cubic, etc. A less transparent way of putting this is to say that the logarithm is the inverse to an exponential.</div>
    <div class="indent">You may have noticed that a lot of computer quantities are expressed as “k”, “M”, “G”, or even “T”, apparently representing the metric scaling factors kilo-, mega-, giga-, and tera-. In the  system these mean factors of a thousand (10<sup>3</sup>), million (10<sup>6</sup>), billion (10<sup>9</sup>), and trillion (10<sup>12</sup>). A base-10 logarithm (log<sub>10</sub>) converts these to 3, 6, 9, and 12. Going a bit deeper, in computer contexts the meaning of these pre-factor names is often slightly modified to fit in with the binary basis of the mass of electronic machinery. In particular “kilo” becomes 2<sup>10</sup>, which works out at 1024, close to the traditional 1000. In computing, a base-2 logarithm is often the default (log<sub>2</sub>) with “k”, “M”, “G”, and “T”, translating to 10, 20, 30, and 40, respectively. These translate to 1024, 1,048,576, 1,073,741,824, and 1,099,511,627,776.</div>
    <div class="indent">Manufacturers often use the base-10 designations, and operating systems base-2. I guess the smaller base-10 version allows marketing teams to trumpet a “larger” capacity for hard disks and flash cards. I’ve often wondered why I only seem to be able to burn up to around 4.2GB on a DVD that is marked 4.7GB. This is presumably part of the reason why. Not the full reason, however, since it should still have more than 4.3GB capacity in operating system terms. Probably, some of the space is reserved for directories, housekeeping, etc. On wikipedia, the operating system/base-2 versions are given the names “kibi”, “mebi”, “gibi”, and “tebi”, according to the IEC [International Electrotechnical Commission] standard, but I had never seen these terms until I looked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte</a> some minutes ago. JEDEC [name originally derived from Joint Electron Device Engineering Council] uses the metric (SI [International System of Units]) names, but only up to giga.</div>
    <div class="indent">Yeah, whatevah! So what old man?</div>
    <div class="indent">Get off my lawn, you young whippersnappers!</div>

    <div class="indent">Back in the 1970s when I was going through school there were no laptops or smartphones. A computer was a big box larger than a sofa with flashing lights and a few k of memory if you were lucky. The input device was a card or tape reader, and output was through another large machine called a “line printer”. You might have magnetic tape or disk storage systems attached for longer term projects. The magnetic tape was contained in a large glass-fronted cabinet with whizzing spools, while the disk system was top-loaded into a mechanism that was the size of a washing machine. Most of the time a user didn’t interact directly with the computer equipment, but rather through a human operator. You had to wait for results. Most people did not have access to such machinery, and probably felt no great desire for such.</div>
    <div class="indent">So back to my school classroom — you didn’t have computers (except the one in your head) — electronic calculators were beginning to appear, but were only available to the well-off. I think towards the end of my schooling calculators were allowed in exams, but we were given to understand that only three significant figures at most were expected in calculations. That is about the level of accuracy of a slide-rule (<a href="http://www.sliderules.info">http://www.sliderules.info</a>), which was allowed, or from using four-figure log tables, as supplied alongside the exam paper. I used a slide rule, while most of my contemporaries opted for tables or a calculator when allowed.</div>
    <div class="indent">Clearly using log tables you are using logarithms for something. For anyone who can remember slide-rules, it may not be obvious, but their operation is also based on logarithms. But what then, was the purpose of logs? The most common operation in the classroom and exams was for multiplying numbers more quickly. You would convert the numbers you wanted multiplied into logs, <i>add them together</i>, and then “antilog” the result. The logarithm avoiding the need for all the shifting and carrying involved in the usual multiplication algorithm of decimal (or binary) numbers. Since division is a sort of inverse multiplication (and even more of a pain to calculate on paper), you might suspect that logarithms can help there too. You would be right — instead of adding you <i>subtract</i> the divisor from the dividend.</div>
    <div class="indent">But how can that be? You’ve only shown the logarithms for numbers with whole number results like 10<sup>3</sup> → 3 in base-10. There is a consistent and continuous way to fill in the gaps so all positive real numbers map onto a real number. What you find is that:</div>

    <div class="standard">\[\log\left( {xy} \right) = \log x + \log y\]</div>

    <div class="indent">I haven’t given the base, since this equation true whatever the base, so long as you stick to one. To get your answer you need to know your base, say <i>b</i>, and then:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[b^{\log_{b}x} = x\] </div>

    <div class="indent">So <i>b</i> to the power of your logarithm is the antilog function. There is also the relation:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\log_{b}\left( b^{x} \right) = x\] </div>

    <div class="indent">These functions mutually invert each other.</div>

    <h2>2 Power relations</h2>
    <div class="standard">The logarithmic conversion of multiplication into addition is based on the formula:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[b^{m}b^{n} = b^{m + n}\] </div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\begin{matrix} m \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} b b \cdots b \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix} \times \begin{matrix} n \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} b b \cdots b \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix} = \begin{matrix} {m + n} \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} b b \cdots b \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix}\] </div>

    <div class="indent">This says that product of the products of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> <i>b</i>s is the product of (<i>m</i> + <i>n</i>) <i>b</i>s. It is an expression of the associativity of multiplication, for those who know what that means:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left( {ab} \right)c = a\left( {bc} \right)\] </div>

    <div class="indent">Another important formula:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left( b^{m} \right)^{n} = b^{mn}\] </div>

    <div class="standard">  \[\begin{matrix} n \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} \begin{matrix} m \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} b b \cdots b \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix} &amp; \begin{matrix} m \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} b b \cdots b \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{matrix} m \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} b b \cdots b \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix} \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix} = \begin{matrix} {mn} \\ \overbrace{\begin{matrix} b b \cdots b \\ \end{matrix}} \\ \end{matrix}\]  </div>

    <div class="indent">This says that the <i>n</i>-th power of the <i>m</i>-th power of <i>b</i> is the product of <i>mn</i> <i>b</i>s.</div>

    <div class="indent">So far we have only looked at whole number powers. However the last formula will lead the way to defining fractional powers, while the formula for addition of powers will lead to a meaning for negative powers. The extension to real numbers depends on “continuity” with respect to powers — this means that as fractions approach closer to a real number the power approaches or “coverges” to a single well-defined real number.</div>

    <div class="indent">So let’s try to find a fractional power:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left( b^{1/m} \right)^{m} = b^{m/m} = b^{1} = b\] </div>

    <div class="indent">So \(b^{1/m}\) is the <em>m</em>-th root of <em>b</em> or \(\sqrt[m]{b}\). So a definition consistent with the power of a power formula is:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[b^{n/m} = \left( b^{1/m} \right)^{n} = \left( \sqrt[m]{b} \right)^{n}\] </div>

    <div class="indent">A similar process from the product of two powers formula gives:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[b^{- m} = 1/b^{m}\] </div>

    <div class="indent">[Remembering/defining that \(b^{0} = 1\).]</div>
    <div class="indent">These considerations, along with the logarithm concept, allow us to make even more connections. Since \(b^{\prime} = b^{\log_{b}b^{\prime}}\) and \(b^{\log_{b}x} = x\):</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[b^{\log_{b}x} = x = {b^{\prime}}^{\log_{b^{\prime}}x} = \left( b^{\log_{b}b^{\prime}} \right){}^{\log_{b^{\prime}}x} = b^{\log_{b}b^{\prime}\log_{b^{\prime}}x}\] </div>

    <div class="indent">Equating the ends and antilogging:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\log_{b}b^{\prime}\log_{b^{\prime}}x = \log_{b}x\] </div>

    <div class="indent">Or more usefully:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\log_{b^{\prime}}x = \frac{\log_{b}x}{\log_{b}b^{\prime}}\] </div>

    <div class="indent">This allows easy conversion from one base to another.</div>

    <h2>3 Tabling some vulgarity</h2>
    <div class="noindent">Armed with the knowledge of the previous section, I made code to generate a crude table for base-10 logarithms (click on “Make table") and compared the values with what the computer came up with (obviously much more accurate).</div>

    <div class="arial text-center">
      <h4>Generate log<sub>10</sub><em>x</em> estimates</h4>
      <table> <tr> <td style="text-align: right;">Base (<em>b</em>):</td> <td><input id="base" size="5" value="1.1" style="font-size: 1em; text-align: right;"></td> </tr> </table>
      <button type="button" onclick="setLog10Table()">Make<br /> table</button>
      <div id="log10table" style="margin-bottom: 10px"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="indent">The javascript code generates a list of powers of the given base (initially 1.1) up to and just beyond 10, and then uses linear interpolation between the whole number values to give an estimate for \(\log_{b}\) for any value of <em>x</em>. To translate to base-10, one just needs to calculate the scaling factor to give \(\log_{10}10 = 1\). Looking at the two result columns, I see that my effort achieves 3-figure accuracy for \(b = 1.1\). Using 1.01 instead of 1.1 gives 5-figure accuracy for the vaules of <em>x</em> listed above, and I expect more generally for the range 1–10. Some improvement might be expected from higher order (quadratic or cubic) interpolation methods, but my purpose is not to create great tables, but rather to see how they might be derived without resorting to calculus, power series and so on.</div>
    <div class="indent">The logarithms as mathematical objects trace back to John Napier (1550–1617), a Scots aristocrat. From English translations of a posthumous publication in Latin (1619), I surmise that his main focus was providing means to ease trigonometric calculations, but the text is quite difficult to follow. Napier did publish tables, with instructions for use, before he died (1614), also in Latin. On the tricentenary of this publication (1914), E.W. Hobson gave a lecture on the discovery, claiming that Napier’s description of the construction was “clear”. To him, maybe. I don’t remember any celebrations in 2014. Perhaps, this has to do with the rise of electronic devices making logarithms “useless”. Intel’s technique for calculating logaithms and so on in its IA-64 chips is at <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.5177">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.5177</a></div>

    <h2>4 Compound uselessness</h2>
    <div class="standard">Elsewhere [<a href="../Power/Power.html">Powering<sup>up</sup></a>] I have elaborated how compound interest arises and how it relates to exponential behaviour. Here I will look at problems such as: If I want a 30% yield on an investment after 10 years, what sort of annual interest rate should I set or seek? In mathematical terms we a looking for a solution <em>x</em> to:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left( {1 + x} \right)^{10} = 1 + 30 = 1.3\] </div>

    <div class="indent">Well you could just try a series of values for <em>x</em>, hopefully using ones intelligence to get closer and closer. This is called “shooting”, and is a respectable method in the absence of anything better. As part of shooting you might apply a bracketing method along with some interpolation, guessing lower and upper bounds (1%? and 3%) and zeroing in.</div>
    <div class="indent">However, here logarithms can save us all that. We have from applying logarithms to both sides:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left. 10\log\left( {1 + x} \right) = \log 1.3\Longrightarrow\log\left( {1 + x} \right) = \frac{\log 1.3}{10} \right.\] </div>

    <div class="indent">Antilogging in whatever base gives:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[1 + x = 1.02658\ldots\] </div>

    <div class="indent">So the desired interest rate would be around 2.7%, not much different from the upper bound of 3%. However, the difference is more significant if you want to double your money — i.e. 100% yield:</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\left. \log\left( {1 + x} \right) = \frac{\log 2}{10}\Longrightarrow 1 + x = 1.0718 \right.\] </div>

    <div class="indent">You can reduce the annual rate to 7.2%, rather than the naive 100%/10=10%. For a bank’s PR/advertising, this looks far less menacing to the intended victims.</div>

    <h2>5 I hear you</h2>
    <div class="standard">At first sight it may appear strange that “an octave” describes a factor of two, since “octo” in Latin and similar sounds in derived languages (e.g. Italian, “otto”) means “eight”. (One can have similar thoughts about October being the tenth month, but that is another story.) The reason is somewhat obscure and historical, as usual, but relates to a series of musical “intervals” — factors/ratios — between notes: 1:1, 9:8, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 5:3, 15:8, 2:1, giving the scale from C: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. [In the key of C major.] The last C is the eighth in the sequence. In musical terms the intervals with smaller integers in the ratio are more “perfect”. So 2:1 is a “perfect eighth”. The “fourth” (4:3) and “fifth” (3:2) are also considered “perfect”, along with “unison” (1:1). There are the less perfect “major” intervals of 5:4 (“third”) and 5:3 (“sixth”), or even 9:8 (“second”) and 15:8 (“seventh”).</div>
    <div class="indent">There are three ratios between steps in the given sequence 10:9 (e.g. E:D), 9:8 (e.g. D:C), and 16:15 (F:E). The last ratio is significantly smaller (1.066 . . .) than the first two (1.11 . . . and 1.125). The gaps between the larger steps are filled with “minor” intervals, giving a 12-tone scale. There are a large number of methods to do this and a bewildering array of designations and meanings. The note inserted between F and G can be referred to as F-sharp (F♯) or G-flat (G♭), and depending on how it is done, may refer to a slightly different frequency.</div>
    <div class="indent">This “just” or “pure” intonation tuning is fine for ensembles with a few players and instruments. However, in large orchestras there is a wide range of sounds that can be produced. Generally tuning is done according to the “chromatic” scale with the octave divided into twelve “semi-tone” steps with constant ratios. We need to find the 12-th root of 2. This can be done with logarithms, or with a calculator/computer. The answer comes out at 1.059. . . .</div>
    <div class="indent">Putting it all together we get the comparison:</div>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Note</th><th>m:n</th><th>m/n</th><th>delta</th><th>Semi-tone</th><th>12-tone ratio</th></tr>
      <tr> <td>C</td> <td>1:1</td> <td>1</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>1</td> </tr>

    </table>


    <div class="indent">The reason for the perfect and major intervals being more “musical” is presumably related to how sound resonates in most instruments and the inner ear canal. There is a fundamental tone and then a series of overtones, which makes instruments playing the same “note” sound different. The overtones are close to a multiple of the fundamental frequency, determined by the size and material of the resonating object. The strength of the overtones tends to be less than the fundamental and die out more rapidly. The perfect intervals create more possibilities for overlapping and reinforcement of overtones, and hence a more “pleasing” sound, unless you are an awkward bastard like me that enjoys a good bit of dischordant music (e.g. the end of Mozart’s “Ein musikalischer Spaß”/“A Musical Joke”, or perhaps “Trout Mask Replica”?).</div>
    <div class="indent">Wikipedia informs me about why we relate octave intervals:</div>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave">“Monkeys experience octave equivalence, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain. Studies have also shown the perception of octave equivalence in rats (Blackwell &amp; Schlosberg 1943), human infants (Demany &amp; Armand 1984), and musicians (Allen 1967) but not starlings (Cynx 1993), 4–9 year old children (Sergeant 1983), or nonmusicians (Allen 1967).” <p class="right">[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave</a>]</p></blockquote>

    <div class="indent">These statements seem somewhat at odds with each other. Maybe “human infants” refers to exclusively to babies? How does bird song fit into this? I am sure experts in music and biology would find many imperfections and errors in the account I have given of these matters. I leave it to readers to check the veracity or not of what I have written.</div>
    <div class="indent">Moving on, sound intensity/loudness is measured using logarithmic concepts. Generally a “decade”/base-10 scale is used — the “bel” or more precisely the decibel (a ratio <em>x</em> in dB \(= 10\log_{10}x\)), thus 1dB represents a ratio of 1.258 . . . , the 10-th root of 10. But ratio of what? To have meaning beyond ratios, dBs need some reference level for the 0dB value. For sound, a reference “sound intensity level” (SIL) of 1pW/m<sup>2</sup> is often used, being close to what is barely detectable by a healthy (young?) ear. </div>
    <div class="indent">In engineering, powers are also often described using dBs, but with an added letter: dBm. In this case, 0dBm represents 1mW. One might be misled by the fact that 10dBm = 10mW to guess that 20dBm is 20mW, but in fact 20dBm = 100mW (20dB is a factor of 10<sup>2</sup> = 100).</div>
    <div class="indent">Further confusion can arise when energy is related to the square of some quantity — e.g. kinetic energy to square velocities or sound intensity to the square of pressure fluctuation. This can lead to 20, rather than 10 appearing in a definition.</div>
    <div class="indent">In electronics, amplifiers usually have some cut-off frequency beyond which the gain falls off, often by a factor that goes as one over the square of the frequency (\(1/f^{2}\)). This behavior is expressed in models that posit parisitic resistance and capacitance in the circuit, along with components put in to ensure stability and so on. Anyway an increase in frequency by a factor of 10 (a decade), leads to a reduction in gain by a factor of 100 (20dB), giving 20dB/decade “roll-off”. Sometimes, rather than a decade, an octave (2×) increase in frequency is used as the measure, giving a 4× reduction in power (6.02 . . . dB), and hence a 6dB/octave roll-off.</div>

    <h2>6 Graph-o-log-y or log-graph-y?</h2>

    <div class="indent">The log-log combination gives straight line! The others are not so useful in this case. Also try changing the exponent (even negative values like for the \(1/f^{2}\) behaviour described earlier, corresponding with \(n = -2\)).</div>

    <div class="indent">We can understand what the log scales are doing here, if we apply logs to the equation \(v = v_1 t^n\):</div>

    <div class="standard"> \[\log v = \log (v_1 t^n) = \log v_1 + n \log t\] </div>

    <div class="indent">The terms \(\log v_1\) and \(n\) are constant, and \(\log t\) varies. For those still reading, I assume some familiarity with linear graphs, often traditionally cast as \(y = m x + c\) with \(m\) and \(c\) being the “gradient” and “constant” terms, respectively. This is the form of our log-log graph if we cast \(\log v\) onto \(y\), \(\log v_1\) onto \(c\), \(n\) onto \(m\), and finally our \(\log t\) scale onto the variable \(x\) (reversing the order of the sum).</div>

    <h2>7 What the frack is a slide-rule?</h2>
    <div class="noindent">To get an understanding of how a slide-rule works, we present a gizmo below, which allows you to slide two bits: the top part with numbers, and the box with the vertical red line in it. The results can be interpreted either as an addition or a subtraction. You may need to be careful where you grab the bits — there is a dead zone around the vertical red line indicating the zero position of the top rule. Also clicking (or touch manipulation on mobile devices, which works on some better than others, depending on device and/or browser) within the box should move the “runner/glass” part, which gives the result of the calculation (or brackets the two terms of the subtraction). The number results presented below the vertical red lines are derived from the relative positions of the bits, along with the scaling factors. I am hoping the principle is “obvious". Assuming so, I will move on below to the slide-rule proper, with logarithmic scales enabling “easy” multiplication.</div>

    <div class="indent">Below we present a “proper” slide-rule with logarithmic scales to give multiplication/division rather than addition/substrtaction. Notice first that there are two vertical red lines at 1 and 10. There is no 0 value. On a logarithmic scale, 0 is at minus infinity (far away to the left, if you believe in such things as infinity) on the rule. Next line up 1 on the top scale with 2 on the fixed scale: notice that the distance between 1 and 2 on the top scale is the same as between 2 and 4 on the bottom. Move the runner to 2 on the top scale, if you feel the need. So we have both 2 × 2 = 4 and 4 ÷ 2 = 2 represented. But what about 5 × 5 = 25? Yes, the runner shows the calculation, but the calculation has run off the end of the bottom rule. How can you get the runner back to the bottom scale? This is the reason I have included the line on 10. Lining it up with 5 on the bottom scale, and then the runner with 5 on the top scale gives the calculation we need up to a factor of 10 (0.500 × 5.00 = 2.50.</div>

    <div class="indent">However, we don’t need to have 1 and 10 markers — instead we can wrap the rule around on itself so 1 and 10 (dropped) are in the same position, giving a circular structure. The object below does this. The inner blue section moves with suitable mouse/touch gestures. It is more difficult to arrange a easy readout in this format, so I have provided a table below with the relevant information, which I hope you can interpret with a bit of experimentation.</div>
