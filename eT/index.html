        <p>We humans are making exponential demands on ourselves and our environment. What I want to do here is explore this thought – the ways in which it is true and not true. Is it a good thing or bad? Can we step off the exponential treadmill? Will we be thrown off?</p>
        <p>Part of this will be to show how we recognize exponential behaviour – growth and decay – through specific examples. Also, I will explore some of the mathematical background and history of how exponential behaviour was discovered and wider uses. Almost all mathematics involves exponential or exponential-like objects.</p>
        <p>Although the work will have some blogish features, it will not be a linear stream of consciousness. I will feel free to go back and revise and add to stuff that has already been written.</p>
        <p>Feel free to comment kindly, and politely. But if this is not for you, never mind. In a way it is more for self-clarification than for seeking fame and fortune.</p>
