\begin{document}
Richardson extrapolation enables accurate limits of sequences to be
achieved more accurately and quickly. We are trying to estimate some
constant $A^{*}$ from a sequence $A_{N}$ or $A_{h}$ where $N\to\infty$
or $h\to0$. We hope that as the limit is approached, the error goes
to zero:

\[
A^{*}=A_{N}+\Delta A_{N}=A_{h}+\Delta A_{h}
\]

Further, we might hope that the behaviour is a simple power of the
parameter, negative in the case of $N$, positive for $h$:

\[
A^{*}=A_{N}+\frac{a_{N}}{N^{\alpha}}=A_{h}+b_{h}h^{\beta}
\]

If the powers have been chosen correctly the multiplicative factors
should tend towards constants in the appropriate limit. We can estimate
these constants by evaluating the $A$'s appropriately, for example:

\[
A^{*}=A_{N}+\frac{a^{*}}{N^{\alpha}}=A_{2N}+\frac{a^{*}}{\left(2N\right)^{\alpha}}\Rightarrow a^{*}\approx N^{\alpha}\frac{A_{2N}-A_{N}}{1-(1/2)^{\alpha}}\Rightarrow A^{*}\thickapprox\frac{A_{2N}-A_{N}/2^{\alpha}}{1-(1/2)^{\alpha}}=\frac{2^{\alpha}A_{2N}-A_{N}}{2^{\alpha}-1}
\]

A similar calculation gives:

\[
A^{*}\thickapprox\frac{2^{\beta}A_{h/2}-A_{h}}{2^{\beta}-1}
\]

We are looking to improve the estimate to $e$ given by:

\[
e_{N}=\left(1+\frac{1}{N}\right)^{N}
\]

On the page ``Basic analysis'', the limit as $\Delta x=1/N\to0$
appears to be linear, so here $\alpha,\beta=1$. So:

\[
e_{N}^{(1)}=\frac{2e_{2N}-e_{N}}{2-1}=2e_{2N}-e_{N}
\]

should give us an improvement.
